# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Why do I need a code of conduct?

A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior for your project’s participants.

## Our Standards

To keep a positive social atmosphere in this project, some decicions and requirements have to be applied:

* write beginner friendly code[1]
* avoid full-stack frameworks[2]
* use [PEP 484: Type Hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) in the code syntax.
* follow the [PEP 8: Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding conventions.


[1]: Write clean and maintable code so beginner level programmers can understand it. This can increase the willingness of new contributors. Separate code in packages and classes, write tests
[2]: Full-stack frameworks are great, especially for prototyping and fast development. Often they are coupling components which can lead to a time-consuming development process
